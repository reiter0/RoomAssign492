Room Scheduler

1,Log into mysql by typing on terminal "mysql -u java -p"   and password "mysql"

2,Create database by entering "CREATE DATABASE 'NameofYourDatabase';"

3,Create table using "create table roomNum(CRN VARCHAR(5), Subj VARCHAR(4), Crse VARCHAR(3), Sec VARCHAR(3), Cmp VARCHAR(3), Cred VARCHAR(20),Part_of_Term  VARCHAR(30), Title VARCHAR(40), DayZ VARCHAR(10), TIME VARCHAR(20), Cap VARCHAR(3), Act VARCHAR(3), Rem VARCHAR(3), Instructor VARCHAR(40), DateZ VARCHAR(12), Location VARCHAR(10), Attribute VARCHAR(30));" 

4,Set up correct classpath for the sched.txt file you wishes you read and input into database.

5,Necessity .java file are in 492/src folder.

6, if you created a new database instead of using "roomAssing", changes the database URL in automateImprot.java(line 20) to apporpriate Path. i.e. "jdbc:mysql://L-1D39-492/roomAssign"

7,Line 32 of automateImport.java has String variable "fileName", be sure to set up the correct path for the location of the "sched.txt"

8, Run automateImport.java first to read the sched.txt file and input the values from the file into mysql table "roomNum". 
   Following will be displayed on the console;
   Connecting to a selected database...
   Connected database successfully...
   Inserting records into the table. 
   Inserted records into the table...
   Goodbye!

9, Run scheduler.java, will be prompted with a GUI "Room List".
   
9-A,Room List has an option for drop down menu which will have all the room lists from the another .txt file, so this can be changed dynamically.
   Clicked on one of the rooms from the drop down to display the Jtable with the values from "roomNum" database. 
   Double click on one of the cells make necessary adjustment and press "ENTER" to reflect it back to mysql. 
   If time or the days is overlapped with another class in the selected room, the pop-up window will says "Time overlap". This will not reflected back to "roomNum" database.
   Make the correct adjustment and it will reflect back to "roomNum" database.

9-B, RoomList Gui has an another option below drop-down menu."Enter CRN Number to DELETE", Enter the Course Reference Number(CRN) that you wish to delete in the Text field and press "OK". Row assign to that particular CRN numbers will be deleted from "roomNum" database. 

10, All the update, insert or delete you performed on "roomNum" database will be view as log in "roomNum_history" database. "roomNum_history" will record any of those three actions done on "roomNum" with the time stamp". This is done by creating a triggers, which is already built into automateImport.java. If you have a new database with diferent name, all the string values conatins "roomNum" in automateImport.java need to change to correct DATABASE NAME.

WARNING!!!You may encounter a bug where you wont be able to type anything in Jtable(pop-up), at this point close the program and re-running it will fix it!!!


STUDENT EVALUATIONS

Step #1: Create the table
create table profile(instructor VARCHAR(100),courseName VARCHAR(100),question VARCHAR(6),nRed INT,avRed FLOAT,mdRed FLOAT,devRed FLOAT,nBlue INT,avBlue FLOAT,mdBlue FLOAT,devBlue FLOAT,nGreen INT,avGreen FLOAT,mdGreen FLOAT,devGreen FLOAT);

Step #2: Prepare the input file by pruning it of unnecessary blank lines. Also some lines containing the headers of columns run together and must be separated. 
example:
Profile 

Subunit: Name of the instructor:  Engineering & Computing Robert Barton  
Name of the course: (Name of the survey)  General Applicat Programming (CSCE102-010-012)  
Comparative line: Compilation:  CSCE Profile Fall 2014  Comparative line: Compilation:  COLLEGE Fall 2014 ALL PROFILES  

Should Be:
Profile 

Subunit:  Engineering & Computing
Name of the instructor:  Robert Barton  
Name of the course: (Name of the survey)  General Applicat Programming (CSCE102-010-012)  
Comparative line: Compilation:  CSCE Profile Fall 2014  Comparative line: Compilation:  COLLEGE Fall 2014 ALL PROFILES  


profile.txt is already fixed.

Step #3: Run studentEval
This will transfer all the data into a MySQL database called 'profile' where it can easily be viewed and searched.
